### Hi there!

I'm Elliot Jones.  
Nothing to see here -- just my Intel company Github account for  
internal use.  
  
- I'm currently hacking internal python tools to leverage custom  
  automation scripts.
- I'm currently learning C++ in my (very) limited free time.
- Ask me about Linux!
  
  
You can find a collection of personal config/workflow files on my  
profile repo [elliotxjones/elliotxjones](https://github.com/elliotxjones/elliotxjone).  
  
I use these daily in WSL running Debian for work, but most of these  
I already use personally on my pc running Gentoo. Keeping them here  
to sync changes made between work and home after I've scrubbed  
anything remotely work sensitive from them (so far just proxy info).  
  
Health and peace!
